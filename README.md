## Sequinzer 6001

The original Sequinzer 6001! 

I wasn't able to get the sequencer to sequence in this version, so I built a lite version (Sequinzer 6001-2a) which does actually sequence. 

This did wind up being a really good exercise in learning React, CSS, prototyping, and working with audio in the browser. 

I also managed to figure out how to build a functional rotary knob from scratch.

Start local servers in order:

In ./src/data/
json-server --watch nodes.json

In ./prototype-2
npm run dev

Here is the wireframe:

Here's a screenshot of the application:
